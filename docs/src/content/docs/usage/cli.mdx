Markdom provides a simple CLI for converting Markdown files to HTML. This is useful for quick, one-off conversions without writing any code.

### Basic Usage

To convert a Markdown file to HTML using the CLI, run the following command:

```bash
npx @tenedev/markdom file.md -o file.html
```

- `file.md`: The input Markdown file you want to convert.
- `-o file.html`: The output HTML file where the converted content will be saved (make sure it ends in `.html`).

### CLI Flags

The Markdom CLI supports the following flags:

- `-o <file.html>`: Specifies the output HTML file name. The file extension must be `.html`.

For example:

```bash
npx @tenedev/markdom README.md -o output.html
```

This command will take the `README.md` file and convert it into an HTML file named `output.html`.

### Best Practices

- **Use a clear output filename**: Always specify a clear, meaningful output filename (e.g., `index.html` or `documentation.html`).
- **Ensure correct file extensions**: The output file must always end with `.html` for proper rendering and recognition by browsers.
- **Check file paths**: Ensure that both the input Markdown file and the output HTML file are located in the correct directories relative to where you run the command.

### Example

#### Input Markdown (`example.md`):

```markdown
# Hello World

This is an example of a Markdown file converted to HTML.
```

#### Command:

```bash
npx @tenedev/markdom example.md -o example.html
```

#### Output HTML (`example.html`):

```html
<h1>Hello World</h1>
<p>This is an example of a Markdown file converted to HTML.</p>
```
