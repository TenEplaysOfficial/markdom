**Markdom** is a fast, customizable Markdown-to-HTML parser. You can use it via the Node.js API or through the CLI for your Markdown conversion needs.

### Using the Node.js API

To use **Markdom** programmatically, follow this simple example:

```ts
import { markdom } from '@tenedev/markdom';

const md = '# Hello World';
const { html, toc } = markdom.parse(md);
console.log(html, toc);
```

- **html**: The generated HTML from the provided Markdown.
- **toc**: A Table of Contents (TOC) based on the headings in the Markdown.

### Using the CLI

To use **Markdom** through the command line, run the following:

```bash
npx @tenedev/markdom README.md -o output.html
```

This will convert the `README.md` file to HTML and save it as `output.html`.

### Requirements

- **Node.js version 16 or higher** is required for both the Node.js API and the CLI.
